    "details": "My first full-time developer position was with Global Thinking in Alexandria, VA right outside DC. At GT my primary work was developing email templates, microsite, and eventually full-fledged sites. One of those sites was my first solo project, Lift Communities. It was a bespoke site integrated with WordPress for customization and ease of use for the client. I learned a lot during this project; how to budget my time and most importantly how to speak up and ask for what I need to deliver the best result."

    "details": "In 2015 I moved to NYC and my first role was as a contract developer with the NBA.I worked on a variety of sites within the limited design framework the NBA employed. It was a good experience overall as I got to work in a faster pace environment than I was used to at that point. My large project was migrating sites from an ancient CMS to a more modern one. I also worked on sites for the WNBA, Hoop Magazine, and Gatorade/NBA summer leagues. "

    "details": "After my contract with the NBA I took a full-time developer position at Reflexions, a digital agency. Here I met my mentor Patrick and continued to work on solo projects. At Reflexions my main client was with the Jed Foundation. I worked on two verticals for them including a redesign of the their main site. I worked directly with a designer and towards the end of the project I became my own project manager, liaising directly with the client to solve their needs."

    "details": "An example of a partner site I worked on is Charting Change for the American Medical Association. This was a more standard project at WSJCS. I worked directly with a designer, an editor, and a project manager. Most projects like this lasted about a month and developers like me worked on multiple projects at a time. Once projects run their course during their promotional period they were effectively abandoned. However, my main project addresses some of this by allowing for continual addition of content. "

    "details": "I was the lead on a project known internally as “podium.” It was a self-publishing tool built on top of WordPress. It allowed for the creation of sites as simple as a chaptered video player through a whole site with lots of media, multiple articles, and infographics. Here are two examples of the wildly different types of sites that could be made with “podium.” The left is a more traditional site with multiple articles and inline infographics. I never saw this through to launch, but after talking to my old boss I know it now has a different name and is not used 100% of the way I intended. However it’s been used to launch a number sites since. So I’m glad they’re still using it. "

    "details": "After leaving the WSJ I was looking for a role on a product team. This landed me on the E-Commerce team at One Kings Lane. I was hired to work on the sites migration from a dated Java platform to a new one with a React front-end. Unfortunately, that project never happened due to choices outside of my control. I did, however, work daily with a number of teams including marketing and the homepage team to deliver custom widgets for site and marketing pages and sites. One of my big exciting projects was when we did a/b testing to redesign the navigation on the page. We had 4 samples plus a control. It was surprisingly fun to address such a challenge as something simple like a sites navigation can have a huge impact on its interaction and customer experience. The consolation to not working on a whole new site from scratch was the Palette project. This is a preact(a lighter version of React) app working with an image sourcing api for displaying the users customizations. It was the last project before I worked on before I was laid off. "

    "details": "Since One Kings Lane, I have worked with a handful of clients including my old company Reflexions, working on the Jed sites again occasionally, and for a few start ups. This has been one of the more difficult challenges I’ve faced as I’ve had to be my own boss, project manager, client liaison, finance department, and sales team-selling myself to clients for the opportunity to work with them. One of my clients during the last year and half was Spring Health. I worked on their homepage and blog redesigns. This site has a lot of motion and though I worked with a designer there was a very collaborative environment with the whole marketing department. It also was very challenging at times do to working on tight deadlines with the clients limited budget."
